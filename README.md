# Codeforces Practice Repository

This repository, **codeforces**, is where I will practice competitive programming questions from platforms like **Codeforces** and **AtCoder**. I will regularly push my latest solutions and code here. The primary languages used in this repository are **C++ (cpp)** and **Python (py)**.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem sources and the contests I participate in:

- **`codeforces/`**: This directory will contain solutions to problems from Codeforces contests and practice problems.
- **`atcoder/`**: This directory will contain solutions to problems from AtCoder contests and practice problems.

Each directory will be further subdivided into folders representing contests, and each folder will contain problem solutions written in either C++ or Python.

---

## Languages Used

- **C++ (cp)**: Used for solving most competitive programming problems due to its speed and efficiency.
- **Python (py)**: Used for some problems, especially when clarity and built-in functionality are more important than execution speed.

---

## Tools Used

- **Vim**: I am using **Vim** as my text editor for writing and testing code. Vim helps me maintain an efficient workflow during contests, and my `.vimrc` is configured to support competitive programming.

## How to Navigate

1. **Codeforces Solutions**: Go to the `codeforces/` directory to view the problems I've solved from Codeforces contests and practice sets.
2. **AtCoder Solutions**: Go to the `atcoder/` directory to view the problems I've solved from AtCoder contests.
3. **Latest Updates**: I will regularly update this repository with the latest solutions from ongoing contests or practice sessions.
